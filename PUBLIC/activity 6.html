</p> 
    <p>I am Queen Marie Lopez, born on the <a href="file:///C:/Users/Licudan/OneDrive/Desktop/lopez%20qm/FINAL%20HTML/PUBLIC%20FOLDER/activity%203.html"> 2nd day of December of 
       year 2006 </a>.I was born in Monching, Siay, Zamboanga Sibugay and was raise there. I am 19 years of age and a first year college 
       student taking Bachelor of Science in Computer Science here at WMSU ESU-Ipil Campus. Marissa Lopez and Alberto Lopez were my parents
       and we are five in the family and I am the youngest child. I have two siblings, sister to be exact since we are all girls. The older
       one is Marvie Lopez while the second or the middle child named Mariel Lopez. <br/>
       <br/>
       Being the youngest is a bit tough since my mother and father got separated when I was in 10th grade and it was really devastating. 
       Now, It's just me and my father living together since my sibling have their own life, but they were still supporting me  in any
       way possible. But still, I was raise being pampered with love and affection so I grow up being a jolly one, the positive kid, 
       and a kid with a joyful charcteristics, and despite of the positiveness I am also a shy kid which it makes me a
       Phlegmatic-Sanguine.<br/>
       <br/>
       Growing up, I am involve in church (PCGAMI) and as a kid that loves to play guitar I am also a musician in our church.
       I also love reading stories, POV's and many more especially in medium app because sometimes it does fit in my situation
       and somehow it'll ease what I felt. Beside stories, I also love to watch movies with friends and family and just spend time 
       with them. I am also fond of dogs since I have mine named Oreo, he's a cutie pie and a sweet dog. My favorite color is blue 
       because I love bright colors and I do love monochrome colors. Adobo and sinigang were my favorite food especially when it was
       cooked by my father. I love my life and I always appreciate it even in lowest, specially then.
