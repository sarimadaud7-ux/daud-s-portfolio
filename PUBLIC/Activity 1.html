<h2>HYPER TEXT MARK UP LANGUAGE (HTML)</h2>

<h3>Is responsible of the content of the Website</h3>

<p>First paragraph. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure content on 
    the we. It provides basic building blocks for webpages by defining elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, 
    and multimedia. HTML uses a system of tags and attributes to mark up content, enabling browsers to interpret and 
    render it visually for users. For example, the p tag defines a paragraph, while the a tag creates hyperlinks, 
    making HTML the backbone of web navigation and content presentation. HTML is a foundation technoloy of the web 
    and works seamlessly with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. It is designed 
    to be both human-readable and machine-interpretable, allowing developers to build structured documents. 
    With advancements like HTML5, the language has incorporated support for rich media, such as video, audio, and 
    interactive elemnts, without requiring additional plugins. This has made HTML more versatile and integral to modern 
    web development.</p>

<h2>CASCADING STYLE SHEET (CSS) </h2>

<h3>Is responsible of the style of the Website</h3>

<p>Second paragraph. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used to describe the visual presentation
    of a document written markup languages like HTML. CSS allows developers to seperate content from design by specefying
    such as colors, fonts, layout, and spacing. This separation enables more efficient and consistent design management,
    as changes to style can be made in one place and applied across multiple pages or elements. CSS operates in a 
    cascading manner, meaning that styles can be layered and prioritized based on rules of inheritance and specificity,
    giving developers fine-grained control over the apperance of web content. CSS is an essential part of modern web
    development because it enhance the user experince by making web pages visually appealing and interactive. It
    supports responsive design, enabling websites to adapt seamlessly to different devices and screen sizes. 
    Additionally, CSS can be applied inline (within HTML elements), internally (in the style tag), or externally
    (via linked .css files), with external stylesheets being the most common and scalable approach. Advanced 
    features of CSS, such as animations, transitions, and grid or flexbox layouts, allow developers to create 
    dynamic and sophisticated web designs without relying heavily on JavaScript.</p>

<h2>JAVASCRIPT (JS)</h2>

<h3>Is responsible of the functionality of the Website</h3>

<p>JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language primarily designed for creating interaxtive and dynamic
    web applications. It is a core of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS, enabling developers to build responsive
    user interface and add interactive features such as animations, form validations, and real-time updates. JavaScript
    is executed web browsers, allowing it to modify the content and behavior of web pages without needing to reload them.
    This client-side capability has made it to indispensable for modern world development. Beyond the browser, 
    JavaScript has expanded its reach with platforms like Node.js, which allows developers to write server-side code.
    This versatility has transformed JavaScript into a full-stack language capable of handling both front-end and
    back-end development. Additionally, it supports numerous frameworks and libraries such as React, Angular, and 
    Vue.js, which streamline the development process and help create feature-rivh applications. Its ability to work
    across platforms and its continuous evolution have made JavaScript one of the most popular programming
    languages in the world.  </p>
